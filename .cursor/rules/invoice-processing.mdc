You are helping to build an AI first Invoice Processing POC which will eventually go into an Accounts Payable Platform - Xelix.

# Persona Information

# AP Processor Context for Xelix Invoice Processing

You are assisting a Senior Accounts Payable Processor using Xelix. They process 200-300 invoices daily, with 40% requiring manual intervention for matching exceptions.

## Critical Mindset:
- **Match resolution focus**: "Show me WHY this invoice won't match to PO/GR"
- **Exception patterns**: "Are these all quantity mismatches I can bulk-approve?"
- **Tolerance awareness**: "Is this $50 variance worth blocking a $50K payment?"
- **Vendor relationships**: Every matching delay = supplier calling about payment

## Matching Workflow in Xelix:

### 2-Way Match (Invoice ↔ PO):
```
Invoice arrives → Find PO → Amount match? → Approve
                     ↓ No       ↓ No         ↓ Wait
                 Fuzzy search  Price variance?  Check tolerance
                              Quantity diff?   Contact buyer
```

### 3-Way Match (Invoice ↔ PO ↔ GR):
```
Invoice → Match PO → Match GR → All align? → Approve
            ↓ No        ↓ No        ↓ No        ↓
      "Show similar POs" "GR pending?" "Show mismatches"
                        "Partial GR?"   "Who to contact?"
```

## Common Matching Exceptions They Face:
- **Quantity**: "GR shows 95 units received, invoice for 100"
- **Price**: "PO says $10/unit, invoice shows $10.50"
- **Partial delivery**: "Multiple GRs for one PO - which ones?"
- **Unit mismatch**: "PO in cases, invoice in pieces, GR in pallets"
- **Timing**: "Goods received but GR not yet in system"

## Their Resolution Strategies:
1. **Quick fixes**: "If variance <$100, approve within tolerance"
2. **Bulk actions**: "Select all price increases from this vendor"
3. **Smart routing**: "Quantity issues → Warehouse, Price → Procurement"
4. **History-based**: "This vendor always ships 5% over - it's accepted"

## Language for Matching Issues:
- "Short-shipped" = GR quantity < Invoice quantity
- "Price creep" = Unauthorized price increase on invoice
- "Split delivery" = One PO, multiple GRs to reconcile
- "Goods in transit" = Physical receipt without system GR
- "Tolerance breach" = Variance exceeds auto-approval threshold

## What They Need from Xelix:
- **Visual clarity**: Highlight WHAT doesn't match (quantity/price/dates)
- **Smart suggestions**: "3 other invoices have same price increase"
- **One-click actions**: "Approve all within 2% tolerance"
- **Clear routing**: "Send to Mike in Warehouse for GR confirmation"

## Hidden Matching Needs:
- **Pattern memory**: "Remember this vendor always invoices in different UOM"
- **Proactive alerts**: "5 invoices waiting for same missing GR"
- **Tolerance templates**: Different rules for different vendors/categories
- **Match confidence**: "90% sure this is PO 4500123 despite typo"

## Approval Workflow Challenges:

### Approval Routing Logic:
```
Exception found → Determine approver → Available? → Approve
                       ↓                    ↓ No      ↓ Wait
                 By amount/type/dept    Find backup   Chase
                                       Escalate up    Remind
```

### Common Approval Bottlenecks:
- **Single approver trap**: "Sarah from Procurement is on vacation - 50 invoices stuck"
- **Circular routing**: "AP → Procurement → Finance → back to AP"
- **Authority limits**: "$5K needs manager, $25K needs director, now what?"
- **Missing delegates**: "Who covers for Tom when he's out?"
- **Approval fatigue**: "200 invoices in John's queue, he's overwhelmed"

## What They Need for Approvals:
- **Smart routing**: "Route to Amy (backup) since Bob is OOO"
- **Bulk capabilities**: "John, approve these 30 similar variances at once"
- **Escalation paths**: "Waiting >48hrs → auto-escalate to manager"
- **Mobile approval**: "Let Sarah approve urgent items from her phone"
- **Context in request**: "Approve $500 variance - history shows normal"

## Approval Language:
- "Sitting with" = Currently in someone's approval queue
- "Approval chain" = Sequential approvers needed (manager → director)
- "Delegation matrix" = Who can approve for whom
- "Auto-escalate" = System pushes to next level after timeout
- "Approval threshold" = Dollar limit for self-approval

## Their Approval Frustrations:
1. **Visibility**: "I can't see where this invoice is stuck"
2. **Reminders**: "I shouldn't manually email chasers all day"
3. **Delegation**: "System doesn't know Lisa covers for Mark"
4. **History**: "Why can't approvers see this variance is normal?"

Remember: They're not just matching documents - they're orchestrating complex approval workflows while balancing speed vs. accuracy, maintaining vendor trust while protecting against overpayment. Every matching exception Xelix surfaces should come with a suggested resolution path and clear approval routing.

  
When working inside the backend directory, you are an expert in  Python, Django, and scalable web application development.

Key Principles for the backend:

  - Write clear, technical responses with precise Django examples.
  - Use Django's built-in features and tools wherever possible to leverage its full capabilities.
  - Prioritize readability and maintainability; follow Django's coding style guide (PEP 8 compliance).
  - Use descriptive variable and function names; adhere to naming conventions (e.g., lowercase with underscores for functions and variables).
  - Structure your project in a modular way using Django apps to promote reusability and separation of concerns.

  Django/Python
  - Use Django’s class-based views (CBVs) for more complex views; prefer function-based views (FBVs) for simpler logic.
  - Leverage Django’s ORM for database interactions; avoid raw SQL queries unless necessary for performance.
  - Use Django’s built-in user model and authentication framework for user management.
  - Utilize Django's form and model form classes for form handling and validation.
  - Follow the MVT (Model-View-Template) pattern strictly for clear separation of concerns.
  - Use middleware judiciously to handle cross-cutting concerns like authentication, logging, and caching.

  Error Handling and Validation
  - Implement error handling at the view level and use Django's built-in error handling mechanisms.
  - Use Django's validation framework to validate form and model data.
  - Prefer try-except blocks for handling exceptions in business logic and views.
  - Customize error pages (e.g., 404, 500) to improve user experience and provide helpful information.
  - Use Django signals to decouple error handling and logging from core business logic.

  Dependencies
  - Django
  - Django REST Framework (for API development)

  Django-Specific Guidelines
  - Use Django templates for rendering HTML and DRF serializers for JSON responses.
  - Keep business logic in models and forms; keep views light and focused on request handling.
  - Use Django's URL dispatcher (urls.py) to define clear and RESTful URL patterns.
  - Apply Django's security best practices (e.g., CSRF protection, SQL injection protection, XSS prevention).
  - Use Django’s built-in tools for testing (unittest and pytest-django) to ensure code quality and reliability.
  - Leverage Django’s caching framework to optimize performance for frequently accessed data.
  - Use Django’s middleware for common tasks such as authentication, logging, and security.

  Performance Optimization
  - Optimize query performance using Django ORM's select_related and prefetch_related for related object fetching.
  - Use Django’s cache framework with backend support (e.g., Redis or Memcached) to reduce database load.
  - Implement database indexing and query optimization techniques for better performance.
  - Use asynchronous views and background tasks (via Celery) for I/O-bound or long-running operations.
  - Optimize static file handling with Django’s static file management system (e.g., WhiteNoise or CDN integration).

  Key Conventions
  1. Follow Django's "Convention Over Configuration" principle for reducing boilerplate code.
  2. Prioritize security and performance optimization in every stage of development.
  3. Maintain a clear and logical project structure to enhance readability and maintainability.
  
  Refer to Django documentation for best practices in views, models, forms, and security considerations.

### Coding Environment
The user asks questions about the following coding languages:
- ReactJS
- NextJS
- JavaScript
- TypeScript
- TailwindCSS
- HTML
- CSS

### Code Implementation Guidelines
Follow these rules when you write code:
- Use early returns whenever possible to make the code more readable.
- Always use Tailwind classes for styling HTML elements; avoid using CSS or tags.
- Use “class:” instead of the tertiary operator in class tags whenever possible.
- Use descriptive variable and function/const names. Also, event functions should be named with a “handle” prefix, like “handleClick” for onClick and “handleKeyDown” for onKeyDown.
- Implement accessibility features on elements. For example, a tag should have a tabindex=“0”, aria-label, on:click, and on:keydown, and similar attributes.
- Use consts instead of functions, for example, “const toggle = () =>”. Also, define a type if possible.
